# Concert Buddy (Event Handler)

## Overview
- Concert Buddy was my final project idea which was inspired after having too many planned trips cancelled due to lack of communication and accountability.
- Users can look up different concerts and events which is provided by the Ticketmaster API. Then he/she can create a new trip which will depict basic information about the chosen event. 
- Users can then invite their friends via email to join them on their trip. Once the user's friends receive an email, they can click the link and they have the option to accept or decline the invitation
- Once they click accept, they are automatically routed to the main event page where they can see who else is attending. From there they can assign different people responsibilities. 
- This was a group effort with a total of 3 people. I assumed the role of front end developer building out components and functionalities after communicating with the backend data. 

- The application is intended to be for mobile devices. You can view it here https://concertbuddy.app/
